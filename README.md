### Project aim
This analysis aims to provide insights into bone tumor based on various factors such as gender, age group etc. By so doing, we seek to indentify trends such as incidence, prevalence, and outcome of treatment methods. Also to make data-driven recommendations and gain deeper understanding of bone tumor.

## Data source
The dataset used was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antimoni/bone-tumor). It is a CSV file and explanation on the 9 different columns of data were provided.

### Tools
The data was cleaned, analysed and visualized using:
- Excel

### Data cleaning/Preparation
During this phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Checked out for empty cells and duplicate values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploring data to answer key questions, such as:
1. Which gender has the most prevalence of bone tumor?
2. Which gender, Age group has the largest number of high grade of tumor?
3. What classification(MSKCC type) of tumor is most prevalent?
4. What percentage of the patients after treatment are Dead/ Alive With Disease/ No Evidence of Disease?
5. What is the most prevalent Site of Primary STS(origin of disease)?
6. What treatment method is most effective?

### Data Analysis
The data was analysed using PIVOT tables and some functions in excel.

### Result/Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. Bone tumor is more prevalent in females than males but males have more incidence of high grade of tumor than females.
2. Of the three Age groups, bone tumor is most prevalent in adults.
3. Most tumor originated from the left thigh and analysis also showed that the left thigh recorded the largest number of high grade of tumor.
4. The most effective treatment method is Radiotherapy + Surgery

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend that:
1. Adult males and females are enlightened more on bone tumor as they are both at risk.
2. Radiotherapy + Surgery should be the advised treatment method.
